## Results
-Theater launch dates were at their highest during the month of May and were still successful during the summer months. Going into the falls months there was a decline in successful launches with the month of December showing the lowest success rates.  
-More campaigns were launched when the goal amounts were under $5000. Outcomes based on goals were 76% more successful in the less that $1000 category and 73% success in the $1000 - $4999 range. Campaigns launched with smaller goal amounts were more successful because of the volume and smaller amounts required to meet their goals. The higher the goal amounts showed less compaigns being proposed with a greater chance of failure.
-Limitations could possibly include how much advertising was utilized.  Were campaigns being funded through word of mouth, based off of previous successes of directors or actors in involved? Or even the experience and reputation of those proposing the campaigns. Genres were not clearly defined.  Romance comedies vs science fiction vs thrillers could be a factor.
Other tables or graphs could have been made of which cities and/or states had the most successful launches.  Also showing the different genres to see if one category was more successful than others.
